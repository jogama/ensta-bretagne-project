# Autonomous vehicle following a level curve. 

Uses a few files from [robmooc](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmooc.html), specifically from [this zip](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmoocpy.zip).


To visualize the the topology the robot will navigate:
    ```$ python3 potential_fields.py```
	
To see a tank following a level curve:
    ```$ python3 follow_level.py```
	
See the code itself for further explanation, or open an issue if anything lacks documentation.
