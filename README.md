# Here this repository explores a novel method for a UUV to follow a level curve. 

Uses a few files from [robmooc](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmooc.html), specifically from [this zip](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmoocpy.zip).

Currently, it simply demonstrates matplotlib's potential field and 3d plotting tools

To run:
    $ python3 potential\_field\_islands.py

And you will see a potentia field plot and a 3d plot.
