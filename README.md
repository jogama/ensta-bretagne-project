# Here this repository explores a novel method for a UUV to follow a level curve. 

Uses a few files from [robmooc](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmooc.html), specifically from [this zip](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/robmoocpy.zip).


To run the curve following:
    ```$ python3 follow_level.py```

And you will see a potential field plot with a robot following a contour.
